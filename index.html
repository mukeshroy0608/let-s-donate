                <h1>The money you donate will help them survive</h1>
                <p>Actually, small donations can make a huge difference. For example, an anti-malaria bed net costs only $2.50 and protects
                     two people for up to three years. The costs of meeting basic human needs in the developing world 
                    are most often far less than the costs for those same services and supplies in the developed world.</p>
